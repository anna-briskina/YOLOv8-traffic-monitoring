# Real-Time Traffic Object Recognition using YOLOv8
This project demonstrates object detection in street view scenes using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model. The goal is to analyze complex urban environments, which is essential for applications like autonomous driving, traffic monitoring, and smart city development.

## Key Features:
- Detects objects in static images with high accuracy (e.g., cars, bicycles, and pedestrians).
- Processes video frames in real-time, tracking objects across frames.
- Provides bounding boxes, confidence scores, and class labels for each detection.

## Example Output:
Below is an example of object detection applied to a street view photo. The model identifies and localizes various objects, such as cars, buses, and pedestrians, with their corresponding confidence scores and bounding box coordinates.

An example output video is included, showcasing the model's ability to detect and track objects in a street view scene. The video highlights the model's performance in real-world scenarios, with detections such as cars, motorcycles, and pedestrians.
